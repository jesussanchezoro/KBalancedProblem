# A Hybrid Strategic Oscillation with Path Relinking Algorithm for the Multiobjective *k*-Balanced Center Location Problem

This paper presents a hybridization of Strategic Oscillation with Path Relinking to provide a set of high-quality nondominated solutions for the Multiobjective *k*-Balanced Center Location problem. The considered location problem seeks to locate k out of m facilities in order to serve n demand points, minimizing the maximum distance between any demand point and its closest facility while balancing the workload among the facilities. An extensive computational experimentation is carried out to compare the performance of our proposal, including the best method found in the state-of-the-art as well as traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.

## Datasets

The dataset of instances used in this work can be downloaded here:

* [Pareto Front of the algorithms included in the comparison](results/kbcl_pareto_front.zip)
* [KBCL instances](results/kbcl_instances.zip)

## Executable

You can just run the BandCollocation.jar as follows.

```
java -jar KBalanced.jar INSTANCE_NAME
```
where ```INSTANCE_NAME``` refers to the path of the instance to be executed. A folder named ```pareto``` will be created with the set of non-dominated solutions created by the algorithm.
